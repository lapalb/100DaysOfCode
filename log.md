## Day 1: 4th May 2018

##### Todays Progress:
Started with revision of class and implemented rectangle. Explored inline functions and how they are different from macros, use of this,and access specifiers and little bit Markdown
##### Thought:
Classes and object are somthing that we generally don't come across while coding. It is generally used in system design ans software design
